Hey peeps,

it's time to announce our gamejam and tell you some detailed information:

The jam is happening on the 22nd of May, starting around 11:00am CEST and finishing at 5:00pm.
We think of it as a relaxed space, an opportunity for everyone who joins to try out whatever they have on their mind.
This can be anything as far as your interpretation of games goes: Sculptures, performance, cargames or a classic 2d platformer.
Everyone is invited, not matter what their experience. You can join as a team or be the sneaky solo game-ninja you always wanted to be.

tinypalace will have a cozy spot for all the jammin' to take place. And if you don't have the equipment (like a portable pc) but still want to join - get in touch with us and we will try to help you out.

The theme will be announced at the festival as well as on [twitter](http://twitter.com/tinytinypalace). You can suggest ideas for it there , via [mail](tinypalace@posteo.de) or just tell us at the festival the days before.

Gamejams can often be very energy-intensive, but this doesn't have to be the norm and you don't have to have a perfect, finished game at the end.
We want it to be a room for experimentation, where you can set your own tempo and goals - either super-hyper fast or laidback sloth-style.

I hope you are cool with that, suggestions on the whole event are always welcome.

Oh, we also have a small [itch.io jam page](https://itch.io/jam/tinypalace), so if you want to join in from outside the festival or just want to play some cool games afterwards, you can check that out.

So, let's have some fun! (until then & then) 

:}
