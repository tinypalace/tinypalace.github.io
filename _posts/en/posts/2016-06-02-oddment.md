Hey everybody,

the festival was a blast, we are quite happy about how every went in the end, mostly thanks to you, who filled that space with life.
To bring something home we were printing gym bags and silkscreen-posters which unfortunately arrived when the festival already was over.
So, we still have a bunch of them and would like to give you the opportunity of grabbing the one or another.
You can see them on the picture above, the costs are..

for **silkscreen** as well as the **gym bag** - **12â‚¬** (inclusive mail)
(in case the delivery doesn't exceeds the EU, otherwise there will be an additional fee)

Just get in touch with us via tinypalace@posteo.de or if you would like to take the short cut,

That's it, next days there will be another post with some pictures and thought gathering on how the festival was for us.
